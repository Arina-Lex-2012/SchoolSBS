    <h1>PRONUNCIATION</h1>
    <h2>/h/, /aɪ/, and /iː/</h2>
    <p>
      <b>/h/</b> <span>H</span> at the beginning of a word is pronounced <span>/h/</span>, e.g. <i>hello</i>.
      (There are a few exceptions, such as an <i>hour</i>.)
      <ul><li>how</li> </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>/aɪ/ </b>This is actually a diphthong (literally ‘two sounds’). It is often
      spelled <span>i</span> before a single consonant followed by silent <span>e</span>, as in the
      example word <i>bike</i>.
      <ul><li>like, nice, dice</li> </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>/iː/</b> Two of the most common spellings of this sound are <span>ee</span> (double e), as in
      <i>meet</i>, and <span>ea</span>, as in <i>repeat</i>.
      <ul><li>see, agree, screen  </li> </ul>
      <ul><li>eat, seat, team, meat, feast, heat, eagel, season, speaker, reasonable</li> </ul>
      <ul><li><span>BUT</span> break, weather, head  </li> </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>/ɪ/, /əʊ/, /s/, and /ʃ/</h2>
    <b>/ɪ/</b> The letter <span>i</span> between consonants is usually pronounced <span>/ɪ/</span>, e.g. <i>fish</i>. NB England (the e = /ɪ/) is irregular.
    <ul><li>sit, fit, while</li> </ul>

    <b>/əʊ/</b> In English, the sound of the letter o in phone is a diphthong (literally ‘two sounds’), i.e. a combination of the two sounds /ə/ + /ʊ/. It is usually spelled by the letter o or o + consonant + e.
